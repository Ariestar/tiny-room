# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Projects Management functionality is a comprehensive system that integrates with GitHub API to showcase and manage personal projects. This feature serves as a central hub for displaying project portfolios, analyzing code statistics, and tracking development activities. The system will automatically sync with GitHub repositories, provide detailed analytics, and offer flexible management tools for controlling project visibility and presentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect my GitHub account to automatically sync my repositories, so that I can showcase my projects without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a GitHub Personal Access Token THEN the system SHALL validate the token and establish API connection
2. WHEN the API connection is established THEN the system SHALL fetch all accessible repositories from the user's GitHub account
3. WHEN repositories are fetched THEN the system SHALL store repository metadata including name, description, language, stars, forks, and last update
4. IF the API rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the sync process fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage which repositories are displayed publicly, so that I can control my professional portfolio presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the projects management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all synced repositories with visibility toggles
2. WHEN the user toggles a repository's visibility THEN the system SHALL update the display status immediately
3. WHEN a repository is set to hidden THEN the system SHALL exclude it from public project listings
4. WHEN the user reorders projects THEN the system SHALL save the custom display order
5. WHEN repositories are filtered by language or topic THEN the system SHALL show only matching repositories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view detailed statistics about my coding activity, so that I can track my development progress and showcase my productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the projects dashboard THEN the system SHALL display commit statistics for the last 12 months
2. WHEN viewing project analytics THEN the system SHALL show language distribution across all repositories
3. WHEN examining individual projects THEN the system SHALL display commit history, contributors, and activity graphs
4. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL include metrics for lines of code, commit frequency, and repository activity
5. WHEN data is outdated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh statistics daily

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize how my projects are presented, so that I can highlight the most important information for visitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a project THEN the system SHALL allow customization of project description and tags
2. WHEN setting project categories THEN the system SHALL support custom categorization beyond GitHub topics
3. WHEN configuring display settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of featured projects for homepage display
4. WHEN updating project information THEN the system SHALL preserve custom settings during GitHub sync
5. WHEN viewing project details THEN the system SHALL display both GitHub data and custom enhancements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to browse projects with filtering and search capabilities, so that I can easily find projects that interest me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting the projects page THEN the system SHALL display projects in a responsive grid layout
2. WHEN using search functionality THEN the system SHALL search across project names, descriptions, and technologies
3. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by programming language, project type, and date range
4. WHEN viewing project cards THEN the system SHALL show key information including language, stars, last update, and description
5. WHEN clicking on a project THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed project view with full information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor API usage and sync status, so that I can ensure the system is functioning properly and stay within API limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing system settings THEN the system SHALL display current GitHub API rate limit status
2. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all API calls and their results
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested solutions
4. WHEN approaching rate limits THEN the system SHALL warn the user and adjust sync frequency
5. WHEN manual sync is triggered THEN the system SHALL show progress and completion status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle GitHub webhook events, so that project information stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is updated on GitHub THEN the system SHALL receive webhook notifications (if configured)
2. WHEN webhook events are received THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding project data
3. WHEN new repositories are created THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the next sync
4. WHEN repositories are deleted THEN the system SHALL mark them as archived rather than removing historical data
5. WHEN webhook configuration is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export project data and statistics, so that I can use the information in other contexts like resumes or presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting data export THEN the system SHALL generate JSON format containing all project metadata
2. WHEN exporting statistics THEN the system SHALL include charts and graphs in exportable formats
3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL support date range selection for historical analysis
4. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL create formatted text suitable for professional use
5. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download links with appropriate file names

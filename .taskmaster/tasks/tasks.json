Ensure the chosen platform's CLI is installed and configured locally.\n<info added on 2025-06-25T03:50:13.106Z>\nChosen platform: Vercel\n\nReasons:\n• Simple integration with React/Vite\n• Automatic preview deployments on pull requests\n• Built-in CDN & image optimization\n\nImplementation plan:\n1. Install Vercel CLI globally: `npm i -g vercel` (one-time).\n2. Run `vercel init` the first time to link local repo with Vercel project (answers: framework = \"React\", output dir = `build`). This creates `.vercel` folder and saves project/ORG ID.\n3. Add minimal `vercel.json` in repo root:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"rewrites\": [\n       { \"source\": \"/(.*)\", \"destination\": \"/index.html\" }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n   This ensures client-side routing works (all paths serve index.html).\n4. Ensure `package.json` has correct build script (already `react-router build`). Vercel will run `npm run build` by default; add a fallback script:\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"build\": \"react-router build\",\n     \"vercel-build\": \"npm run build\"\n   }\n   ```\n5. Push `.vercel`, `vercel.json`, and script change to GitHub. Because Vercel project is linked, pushing to `master` automatically triggers build & deploy.\n6. Verify deployment in Vercel dashboard. Expected production URL: `https://<project>.vercel.app`.\n7. Once deployment is live, test navigation, gallery modal, footer animations. \n8. If issues appear (e.g., 404 on refresh), double-check `vercel.json` rewrite and that `react-router build` outputs `static/` assets under `build`.\n\nNext step after this subtask: configure continuous deployment settings (subtask 15.2) and run first deploy (15.3).\n</info added on 2025-06-25T03:50:13.106Z>",
